# Group-Project-8

Project Goal

In this project, we will work on unsupervised machine learning. Imagine you are Uber and you want to give recommendations on where drivers should be to maximize their chances of finding a ride. We will use Machine Learning to create this recommendation algorithm.

Take the following dataset: uber-trip-data Group1: April Group2: May Group3: June Group4: July Group5: August Group6: September

Try to see the number of optimal clusters
Find these clusters on a map
Now separate these clusters according to the time of day
Look at the difference between KMeans and DBSCAN
Expectations

Clean, well-commented code
Clean data with EDA
Clear board in Trello with logged time for each task
Clear descriprion of each model
At least 3 different models including Kmeans and DBSCAN
Use Elbow method
Use folium library to create the map
Models implementation and comparison
Vizualisation of the main results
Deliverables

'1. Uber.csv with clean and encoded data
'2. Uber.ipynb' with all code concerning data cleaning and modelling
'3. Slides/dashboard/notebook with your results (for each model and final table with models comparison).
'4. Please state the conclusion about usability of each model.
'5. Trello board.
